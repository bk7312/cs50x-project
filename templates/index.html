        <summary>Need a hint?</summary>
        As you can see from the navigation bar, one of the link is grayed out so you can't click on it.
        Perhaps you can try inspecting the page to find the link?
        <details>
            <summary>How do I inspect the page?</summary>
            I'm assuming you're on a desktop browser, if you are, right-click on the link and click "Inspect".
            You should see your browser's developer tool open up. Under the "Elements" tab, look for the link
            on the navigation bar. Once you find it, you can visit the link. Unfortunately, you probably can't
            do this on a mobile browser on Android/iOS.
            <details>
                <summary>I give up...</summary>
                You should see something like class="nav-link disabled" href="/register" or href="/login", clicking on
                the link in href should work. You can also navigate directly to login2win.onrender.com/register instead.
                Alternatively, can remove the word "disabled" and leave class="nav-link" to make the link clickable.
