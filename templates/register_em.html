    </form>
    <details>
        <summary>Need a hint?</summary>
        We both know that <span class="mono">#me&email*net</span> is not a real email address, but how can we submit it
        anyway? Try to inspecting the email input field and find a way around it.
        <details>
            <summary>How do I inspect the email input field?</summary>
            I'm assuming you're on a desktop browser, if you are, right-click on the input field and click "Inspect".
            You should see your browser's developer tool open up. Under the "Elements" tab, look for the email input
            field and see how it works, try to find a way to submit something that's not an email address.
            Unfortunately, you probably can't do this on a mobile browser on Android/iOS.
            <details>
                <summary>I give up...</summary>
                You should see that the email input field is of type="email", simply change "email" to "text" and you'll
                be able to submit that weird email address.
