    <ol>
        <li>Introduce the casual user to their browser's developer tools.</li>
        <li>Show how easy it is to bypass client-side input validation.</li>
        <li>Stress the importance of server-side input validation.</li>

                    If you're viewing this page on a laptop/desktop browser, chances are, you can open your browser's
                    developer tools from the settings menu somewhere or by right-clicking anywhere and selecting
                    "Inspect". If you're viewing this on a mobile browser, you probably don't have access to the
                    developer tools.

                    Lots of things, you can see how the html page is rendered. You can play around with the webpage and
                    modify it to your liking under the "Elements" tab. You can see how your browser communicates with
                    the server/internet under the "Network" tab, and you can even play around with JavaScript and write
                    some code under the "Console" tab. For more info on the developer tools, click <a
                        href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview/">here</a>.

                    Client-side input validation refers to validating user input while on the browser. As you can
                    probably tell from the game, it's very easy to break it. Which is why it's crucial to implement
                    server-side input validation and check the user's input on the server. Client-side input validation 
                    is still useful to implement as it can help guide the user into making correct inputs.
