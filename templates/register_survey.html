        <summary>Need a hint?</summary>
        How are you supposed to select "pink" when it doesn't even exist in the dropdown? Try to inspect the dropdown
        menu, see what happens under the hood when you make a selection.
        <details>
            <summary>How do I inspect the dropdown?</summary>
            I'm assuming you're on a desktop browser, if you are, right-click on the dropdown menu and click "Inspect".
            You should see your browser's developer tool open up. Under the "Elements" tab, look for the various
            options and see how it works, try to find a way to submit something that's not in the options.
            Unfortunately, you probably can't do this on a mobile browser on Android/iOS.
            <details>
                <summary>I give up...</summary>
                You should see several options with value="color", simply change any one of them to "pink" and select
                it, then click on submit.
