    <p>Here's your first challenge, creating a username.</p>
    <p>Your username must be exactly 16 characters long so find a way to submit it.</p>
    <form action="/register" method="post" class="game-form">
        <input autocomplete="off" autofocus required type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username" minlength="4"
            maxlength="8">
        <button class="btn btn-primary" type="submit" name="validate" value="username">Submit Username</button>
    </form>
    <details>
        <summary>Need a hint?</summary>
        How are you supposed to submit a 16 character long username when the input field doesn't let you enter more
        than 8 characters? Try inspecting the input field.
        <details>
            <summary>How do I inspect the input field?</summary>
            I'm assuming you're on a desktop browser, if you are, right-click on the input field and click "Inspect".
            You should see your browser's developer tool open up. Under the "Elements" tab, look for the username
            input field. Once you find it, try to find what might be limiting the input field to just 8 characters.
            Unfortunately, you probably can't do this on a mobile browser on Android/iOS.
            <details>
                <summary>I give up...</summary>
                You should see something like maxlength="8", double click on the number 8 and change it to 16. That
                way, you can enter 16 characters and continue with the challenge.
